Loan Default is the failure to repay a debt, including interest or principal, on a loan or security. For creditors, though default risks are calculated in advance, loan default is still a significant source of loss of revenue. Data from the Lending Club shows that defaulted loans funded between 2012 and 2017 cost investors $471,319,912.18. Machine learning and predictive modeling could significantly reduce this loss and provide better returns on investment.
